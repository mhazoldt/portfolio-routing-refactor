                       "React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook. He was influenced by Angular (application platform) and XHP, an HTML component framework for PHP.[7] It was first deployed on Facebook's newsfeed in 2011 and later on Instagram.com in 2012.[8] It was open-sourced at JSConf US in May 2013. React Native, which enables native Android, iOS, and UWP development with React, was announced at Facebook's React.js Conf in February 2015 and open-sourced in March 2015. On April 18, 2017, Facebook announced React Fiber, a new core algorithm of React framework library for building user interfaces.[9] React Fiber will become the foundation of any future improvements and feature development of the React framework.[10]"
